This repo is created for my own widh to remember some algorithms, old and classic.

CMake is used to build solutions/projects - I am using Windows, so no other OS were tested. Nevertheless I used CMake, because I wanted to did it.
To build create **build** directory in the root directory of the project and run **cmake ..** from **${root}/build**. In case of Windows you will see .sln here - you know what to do next.
